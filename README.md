# My-Ahirani
An android app to learn 'Ahirani'- a local language spoken by khandeshi people of north maharastra .
I have taken motivation to develop this app by using the android udacity miwok app project. This app includes Photos of the words , corresponding audio file as ahirani
translation in devnagri script. It's a small initiative to protect my local mother tounge.
